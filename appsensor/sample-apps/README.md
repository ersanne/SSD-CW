AppSensor Sample Applications
=========

Quickstart
------------

If you are just wanting to get a demo going, see the [DemoSetup.md](DemoSetup.md) guide.

------------

This is the parent directory of several sample applications

**Note: the applications in the sample-apps/ directory generally require java 1.8 or greater.**

There are 2 different mechanisms for using these sample applications

Standalone container
------------

If you'd like to deploy one of these applications to a standalone application server or servlet container, follow these simple steps: 

* Download the source code (either zip download or git clone)
* Go into the folder containing the application you want to deploy (e.g. 'simple-dashboard')
* Execute 'mvn package'
* Look in the 'target' folder that gets generated and find the '.war' file
* Deploy this WAR file into your application server / servlet container and start it up
* You should now be able to interact with the application locally

IDE-managed container
------------

If you'd like to deploy one of these applications to a standalone application server or servlet container, follow these simple steps: 

* Download the source code (either zip download or git clone)
* Import the application into your IDE (using 'import maven project' mechanism)
* Setup an IDE managed container if you don't have one already
* Add the application to your container
* Startup the container
* You should now be able to interact with the application locally
